#Set/unset BIN device an path

:env

*Usage
-
 *env [option] [value]
 
*Options
- d : set bin device (use -d <dev>)
- p : set bin path, note that if
  there is a trailing ";" it's 
  converted to ":"
- u : unset value of option
  ex : *env -up

=Notes
 Vice soft device seems to need a
 path for binaries without ":" in
 the name, whereas SD2IEC requires
 it.
